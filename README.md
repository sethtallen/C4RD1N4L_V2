# C4RD1N4L_V2
This is a bot which serves as a front end via Discord for RBVC voice conversion. This bot initially was an inside joke, but has since evolved into something useful. I've since stripped out the funny bits. Hence the V2 :^)

This bot will accept the audio file along with variables such as the target model and pitch shift variable. It will serve the file to the input destination and it will monitor the output destination. It will reject too many arguments, incorrect models, and monitor a whitelist given the conversion server runs on my personal hardware.
